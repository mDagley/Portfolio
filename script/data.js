            "outcomes": "This was my first time trying Express.js, it was a pretty minimal server set up. I do still want to revisit this project and come up with a more robust way of generating the content. Currently I have each paragraph stored in a database and use a random number generator to pick which paragraphs are selected. I'm thinking I'd rather come up wtih a bank of words and create unique paragraphs that way.",
